# Improve your productivity and speed with a custom terminal prompt!
```md
Idea: Maximize your productivity with the `Starship` prompt and customizations
```

## 0. Why should I care about my prompt?
A well configured prompt can provide you with contextual information and tools at a glance and before you run your commands, and that can save a whole bunch of time and potential errors!  
In doubt? Watch till the end of the video!

## 1. Install Nerd Fonts and Configure VSCode Settings for Starship to render icons properly
1. Download any [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) from here. You can't go wrong with the [Hack Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.2.2/Hack.zip) which is what I am using
2. Setup your VSCode to render the font in the integrated terminal and the editor.  
   (Use **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P** and type Open User Settings JSON) and enter these two lines in the json
   ```json
   {
      "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Hack Nerd Font Mono",
      "editor.fontFamily": "'Hack Nerd Font Mono', Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace",
   }
   ```
   The example shows Hack Nerd Font, but do replace with the font you have downloaded

## 2. Setup and install Starship
1. Why [Starship](https://starship.rs/)?  
    It is as they say, `A minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!`  
The key part here is that it is highly customizable and can be modified to suit YOUR needs and you can even create custom plugins that are relevant to how you use your terminal everyday.  

   I will also share my custom configuration of Starship and how I use it at the end. [SPOILER!](#4.-my-starship-config)  

2. Install it by following the [official documentation](https://starship.rs/#quick-install)
3. Add it to the end of your zsh dotfile -  `~/.zshrc`, by default
   ```zsh
   eval "$(starship init zsh)"
   ```
4. The default config should be good enough, and it is recommended that you travel the rabbit hole of [customizations and plugins](https://starship.rs/config/#prompt) to truly understand how everything works!

## 3. Configure
1. You have absolute control over your prompt with Starship. The entire prompt is represented by the `format` variable you have defined in your config file. It is by default set to all available plugins. You can customize each plugin the way you want to. Check the [documentation](https://starship.rs/config/#prompt) and [references](https://starship.rs/presets/#tokyo-night) for inspiration
2. I use the [Github Dark Dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) color theme for my VSCode and have chosen a color scheme for the prompt closely matching the same. You can feel free to edit it 

## 4. My Starship Config
1. Replace your config with this at `~/.config/starship.toml`
```toml

2. Since I do not always want to display kubernetes information (and since I always have the file at ~/.kube/config) I have created an alias which basically creates and removes a dummy file in the current directory, and which is used to enable/disable the kubernetes plugin. You can add this to your ~/.zshrc to use the same workaround
```zsh
alias k8s="touch .k8s"
alias xk8s="rm .k8s"
```
3. Put it to the test. Try logging into your azure subscription, or aws subscription, or change your k8s namespace and test!
To switch K8s namespace quickly, you might also like this alias
```zsh
alias ksn="kubectl config set-context --current --namespace"
```
