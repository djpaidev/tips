# Tricks to extract and manage shell outputs better
```
Idea: A set of recommendations/tricks to manage and extract shell output
```

## 1. Copying output of last command from VSCode
  1. Edit Keybindings (Use Cmd+Shift+P and search for Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON))
  2. Add following keybinding to the array to copy the output to clipboard
  > Copies last command output, and not the last command, [the name would be fixed in next release!](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/171073)
  ```json
    {
      "key": "cmd+ctrl+o",
      "command": "workbench.action.terminal.copyLastCommand" 
    }
  ```
  Known limitation - Does not work if the output from the last command is longer than the terminal scroll size

## 2. Pipe output to copy alias
  1. In your zshrc dotfile, create alias for copy command based on your Operating System
  ```zsh
     # alias copy="xclip -sel clip" # Linux
     # alias paste="xclip -out -sel clip" # Linux
     alias copy="pbcopy" # MacOs
     alias paste="pbpaste" # MacOs
  ```
  2. Now you can pipe the output to clipboard by doing
  ```zsh
    # <command> | copy
    ls | copy
    echo "hello world" | copy
  ```

## 3. Create functions to record all commands and outputs to a file
  1. In your zshrc dotfile, add these functions
  ```zsh
  # Record outputs from session with a custom suffix (or defaults to date)
  function record() {
    suffix=$1;
    [[ -z "${suffix}" ]] && suffix=$(date "+%Y%m%d")
    export RECORD_FILE="${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}"
    exec > >(tee -a "${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}")
  }

  # Open recordings based on suffix or date
  function open-recording() {
    suffix=$1
    [[ -z "${suffix}" ]] && suffix=$(date "+%Y%m%d")
    export RECORD_FILE="${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}"
    echo "${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}"
    \less -r "${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}"
  }
    
  # Delete specific output recordings, or all sessions
  function delete-recording() {
    suffix=$1
    if [[ -n "${suffix}" ]]; then
      # using \command to prevent any alias from overwriting the command
      \rm "${HOME}/.zsh-recording-${suffix}" 
    else
      echo 'delete all recordings? [y/n]'
      read ans
      [ $ans = 'y' ] && echo 'deleting files...' && \rm -v "${HOME}/.zsh-recording-"* || echo 'cancelled.'
    fi
  }
  ```
  1. To start capturing all outputs to a file, run `record` command. It will start printing everything to a file. 
  2. If you open the files in VSCode, you will see a lot of control characters and escape sequences in the file, you can use the `less -r` command to render it as it was shown in the terminal stdout. [Refer here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/114355/cat-and-less-give-different-output)
  > If you find a way to render it correctly in VSCode, feel free to create a PR!

## 4. If you want to copy the entire terminal session from VSCode, try these
  1. [Terminal Capture](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=devwright.vscode-terminal-capture) extension and [source code](https://github.com/mikekwright/vscode-terminal-capture/blob/master/src/extension.ts) that gave idea for binding multiple commands to a single key as shown below

  OR

  1. Install [multi-command](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryuta46.multi-command) Extension to execute multiple commands from one keybinding! and 
  [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49612562/8453502)
  ```json
    {
      "key": "cmd+ctrl+c",
      "command": "extension.multiCommand.execute",
      "args": {
        "sequence": [
          "workbench.action.terminal.selectToPreviousCommand",
          "workbench.action.terminal.copySelection",
          "workbench.action.terminal.clearSelection"
        ]
      }
    }
  ```
