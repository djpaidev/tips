# Level up your Terminal History with these options, plugins, and fzf!
```
Idea: A collection of recommendations that can make it easy to work with your terminal history
```

1. Set your ZSH options to save better history - Refer [ZSH Official Documentation](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Options.html)
```zsh
setopt \
  extended_history \
  hist_expire_dups_first \
  hist_find_no_dups \
  hist_ignore_dups \
  hist_ignore_space \
  hist_save_no_dups \
  share_history
```

2. Export environment variables
```zsh
export HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history # If you are using OhMyZsh this may already be set
# Make sure history is not lost or overwritten
export HISTSIZE='1000000000' 
export SAVEHIST='1000000000'
```

3. Use Plugin [ZSH Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
This will suggest commands as you type
```zsh
# The setup would depend on your plugin manager, if you are using OhMyZsh, include it as below after installation (git clone)
plugins=( 
    # other plugins...
    zsh-autosuggestions
)
```

4. (Optional) Use ZSH Plugin [History Substring Search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)  
This will allow to automatically search based on what you type, also supports fuzzy search with the setting below
```zsh
export HISTORY_SUBSTRING_SEARCH_FUZZY=1 # Allow fuzzy search on history
# Keybindings to work with VSCode integrated terminal, tested on Mac
# Please refer official repo above if the following keybindings do not work
bindkey "$terminfo[kcuu1]" history-substring-search-up
bindkey "$terminfo[kcud1]" history-substring-search-down
```

5. Install and configure [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)  
This is an absolute gamechanger - from finding file paths, to searching in history, it is practically a MUST HAVE for your terminal
> Make sure to source fzf-completions and fzf-keybindings to your zshrc. This is done automatically with git based install, but with brew install, make sure you run `$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install` after fzf is installed
```zsh
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border'
export FZF_COMPLETION_TRIGGER="*" # To have fuzzy autocompletion suggestions after you enter * and press Tab
```
Now try `Ctrl+R` history search keybinding, and verify fzf in action!
