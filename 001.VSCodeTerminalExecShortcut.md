# VSCode Setting to save time editing and running commands on the CLI
```
Idea: Bind a Single Shortcut to run commands in terminal - faster than selecting > Ctrl+C to copy > shifting focus to terminal > Ctrl+V to paste > Enter to execute
```

## Steps
1. Open Terminal
2. Edit Keybindings (Use Cmd+Shift+P and search for Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON))
3. Add keybinding to the array (ctrl+t or cmd+t)
```json
{
 "key": "cmd+t",
 "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText"
}
```
4. Test by running a sample command (Just run Cmd+t)
```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

5. Test a complex example
```bash
# for multi line commands, you can select all the lines and then run Cmd+t
echo "Hello
Multi
Verse
"

node
console.log("hello world")
.exit

python
print("hello world")
exit()

```
